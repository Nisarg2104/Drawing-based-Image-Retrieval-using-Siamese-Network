# Drawing-based-Image-Retrieval
In this project we have used Siamese Networks with Triplet Loss for Drawing based Image Retrieval. For detailed specifics please refer to the pdf file.
Majority of the work on this project project was done in Google Colab and therefore it only contains the final version on Github.
